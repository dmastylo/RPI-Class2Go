# Normally, the relay daemon will accept events from any machine that can reach it on the
# network. If you only want programs on this machine to be able to send events to the relay,
# set the localhostOnly flag.

# Use this section to specify attributes for inclusion in every event uploaded.
# You can use these attributes to distinguish data centers, hosts, or other
# subsystems. Note that Scalyr Logs will by default provide a serverHost
# attribute based on this server's hostname. You may use any attribute names
# you like; the examples below are merely examples.
# 
# attr.zone=us-east-1a
# attr.serverHost=frontend1

# Use this parameter to specify a regex whitelist for metric names.
# Only metrics whose name matches the whitelist are forwarded to Scalyr.

# Set Verbose=true to echo all data points to stdout. WARNING: this can be bulky!
Verbose=false

# Set logThreshold to a value other than 3 to control the amount of internal logging
# generated. Smaller numbers generate more logging. 3 is the default.

# logThreshold=3

# At the specified interval, we emit a line to stdout indicating how many events
# have been forwarded to Scalyr. Set to -1 to disable this output.

# Amount of RAM to use to buffer events for uploading to the Scalyr server. You
# should not normally have to adjust it. If your data volume is high (more than 1000
# data points / second), you might need a larger value to avoid occasional
# data loss due to ephemeral connectivity problems. If this happens, stdout will
# contain notices of buffer overflow.
# 
# If you do increase MaxBufferBytes, you may also need to increase the Java heap
# size, as specified in run.sh.
